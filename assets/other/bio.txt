I got my bachelor's degree in physics from Université de Montréal in 2019. During my undergraduate studies, I did two 4 months research internships at the Laboratoire de simulation et modélisation du mouvement, where I developed a passion for research. I then started a master's degree in biomedical engineering at Université de Montréal. Given the potential of my project and my research skills, I was offered a fast-track to PhD. I am currently finishing this PhD with even more enthusiasm than when I started the project.
