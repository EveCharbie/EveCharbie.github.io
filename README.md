# Personal Website

This repository contains the python script to generate [Eve Charbonneau's home page](https://github.com/EveCharbie/EveCharbie.github.io/index.html). 
This website summarizes my research highlights.

## Credits

The overall design and open-sourcing the script is inspired by [Jon Barron's awesome template](https://jonbarron.info/) and some functionality is inspired by [Andreas Geiger's cool website](https://cvlibs.net)!
